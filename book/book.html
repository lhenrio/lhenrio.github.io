Distributed and communicating objects are becoming ubiquitous. In
global,<br>
Grid and Peer-to-Peer computing environments, extensive use is made of <br>
objects interacting through method calls. So far, no general formalism
has<br>
been proposed for the foundation of such systems.<br>
<br>
Caromel and Henrio are the first to define a calculus for distributed<br>
objects interacting using asynchronous method calls with generalized <br>
futures, i.e., wait-by-necessity -- a must in large-scale systems,
providing both high structuring <br>
and low coupling, and thus scalability. The authors provide very
generic <br>
results on expressiveness and determinism, and the potential of their <br>
approach is further demonstrated by its capacity to cope with advanced <br>
issues such as mobility, groups, and components.<br>
<br>
Researchers and graduate students will find here an extensive review of<br>
concurrent languages and calculi, with comprehensive figures and
summaries. <br>
<br>
Developers of distributed systems can adopt the many implementation <br>
strategies that are presented and analyzed in detail.<br>

    Do
you know why fairies are so good at helping people in trouble? Can
you imagine how they learn all theirtricks and spells? Well, they go to
school of course! All young fairies must go to school to earn their
wings and, let me tell you, Fairy School is no child's play. To
graduate fairies must master the elements, befriend
mythical&nbsp;&nbsp;
creatures,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; most&nbsp;&nbsp;
importantly,&nbsp;&nbsp; learn&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp;
value&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp;
collaboraton.&nbsp;&nbsp; Points&nbsp;&nbsp; areawarded&nbsp;
forachievementsa n dhelpfulness.&nbsp;
The&nbsp; fairy&nbsp; who&nbsp; graduateswith&nbsp; the&nbsp;
most&nbsp; pointswill&nbsp; be&nbsp; rewarded&nbsp;
with&nbsp; thefnest wings.<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

    <h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The main originality of the game is
        the importance given to positive interaction between players.</span></h2>
    <p>When creating this game, I wanted to create an <em>interaction mechanism
        where players propose interesting actions to other players instead of
        trying to block them</em><br>
      This works because each player score points and gets bonuses when his cards are used by
      other players. This measure of the <em>social usefulness</em> of each
      player is a significant aspect of the game.<br>
</p>
    <h2>The rest of the mechanism is based on deck-building with a lot of
      control on the played cards</h2>
    <p>Each turn players: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Fill their board with cards of their deck (choosing which card goes
        where)</li>
      <li>play 4 cards of their board</li>
      <li>activate their cards and some cards of their neighbors</li>
      <li>improve their deck by acquiring new cards</li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
